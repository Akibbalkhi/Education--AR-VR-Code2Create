Problem Statment- There is often a disconnect between the teacher and the students due to content and mode of presentation in the classroom. This gap reduces the effectiveness of education in general and might lead to incorrect conceptual ideas in the minds of students. Make use of AR technology to reduce this disconnect between student and teacher.<br>
Solution-<br>
We are building an AR/VR app which would completely eradicate the gap between the the students and teachers. We provide complete visualisation of the the given topics of tetbooks to the students in both VR/AR modes. firstly we augment the models of the given topics on the mobile screen then with a single tap the student could go to the VR mode where in a virtual room he could inspect each and every aspect of the animated models and understand concepts in a better way.<br>
We have left no table unturned in making learning as conceptual as possible.<br>
By using 3d animated models and great audio quality we our teaching technique are no loger boring and monotonous.<br>
